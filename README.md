## 📘 About This Project

This repository serves as a **mini interactive Linux handbook** designed for:

- **Beginners** who are just starting their Linux journey
- **Students** studying operating systems and system administration
- **Developers** who want to understand the platform they deploy on
- **IT Professionals** preparing for certifications like Linux+, RHCSA, or LFCS

Every document is written with clean Markdown formatting, code examples, ASCII diagrams, and interactive collapsible sections to make learning engaging and effective.

## 📂 Documentation Structure

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Introduction](docs/introduction.md) | What is Linux? GNU/Linux explained. The GNU Project and open-source philosophy. |
| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | GNU/Linux system architecture: user space, kernel space, libraries, and hardware interaction. |
| [Linux Kernel](docs/linux-kernel.md) | Kernel internals: process management, memory management, device drivers, filesystems, and system calls. |
| [Filesystem Hierarchy](docs/filesystem-hierarchy.md) | The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) — understanding `/`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, and more. |
| [Key Concepts](docs/key-concepts.md) | Everything is a file, permissions, multi-user design, multitasking, and modular architecture. |
| [Basic Commands](docs/basic-commands.md) | Essential Linux commands every beginner should know, with examples and exercises. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Start with **[Introduction](docs/introduction.md)** to understand what Linux is and why it matters.
2. Move to **[Architecture](docs/architecture.md)** to learn how a GNU/Linux system is structured.
3. Dive into the **[Linux Kernel](docs/linux-kernel.md)** to understand the core of the operating system.
4. Explore the **[Filesystem Hierarchy](docs/filesystem-hierarchy.md)** to navigate Linux with confidence.
5. Master **[Key Concepts](docs/key-concepts.md)** like permissions, multi-user design, and modularity.
6. Practice with **[Basic Commands](docs/basic-commands.md)** to build hands-on skills.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- A Linux terminal (any distribution — Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with opening a terminal and typing commands
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment

> 💡 Tip  
> Don't have Linux installed? You can use a free virtual machine (VirtualBox, VMware) or a cloud instance to practice. Many online platforms also offer browser-based Linux terminals.
